# Smart-Power-Monitor-Web-App

🔌 Smart Power Monitor – Web-Based IoT Dashboard
A simulated IoT web application that tracks and displays real-time power consumption data from virtual home appliances. This project is designed to promote energy efficiency by visualizing usage patterns, sending alerts, and allowing users to simulate control over connected devices.

🧠 Features
📊 Real-time power usage dashboard

📈 Historical consumption trends (daily, weekly)

🔔 Smart alerts for over-usage

🕹️ Simulated control panel (turn devices ON/OFF)

💬 WebSocket/MQTT support for live updates

💡 Fully responsive UI for desktop & mobile

⚙️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js / React.js, TailwindCSS, Recharts

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: Firebase (or MongoDB)

IoT Simulation: Mock device data using JavaScript/Node.js scripts

Live Data: WebSocket / MQTT simulation

🚀 Getting Started
This project can be fully simulated without real hardware. Ideal for students, developers, or startups practicing IoT concepts and frontend-backend integration.
